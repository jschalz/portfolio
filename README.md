# README

This repo contains samples of technical writing from my previous roles and my [Medium blog](https://grem.medium.com/).

## Topics
- [Guides](/guides)
- [API documentation](/api-docs)
- [Best Practices](/best-practices)

## Why the PDFs?

Most of the documentation I've worked on is still actively updated. In order to not misrepresent my work, I've included snapshots of the docs in this repo.
